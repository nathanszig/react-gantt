## Usage
To use the Gantt React Component in your project,
import it and pass the required data as props and the optional customize props.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Gantt from "free-react-gantt";
import 'free-react-gantt/dist/style.css'

const YourApp = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Your Application</h1>
      <Gantt data={yourData} customize={yourCustomizeJson} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default YourApp;
```

### Data Structure

The component expects data in the following structure:

```json
{
    "users": [
        {
            "id": {"type": "number"},
            "firstName": {"type": "string"},
            "lastName": {"type": "string"},
            "tasks": [
                {
                    "id": {"type": "string"},
                    "project": {
                        "name": {"type": "string"},
                        "id": {"type": "number"}
                    },
                    "name": {"type": "string"},
                    "start": {"type": "string"},
                    "end": {"type": "string"},
                    "description": {"type": "string"}
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
It also expected an optional props "customize" to allow the customization of
few specifics elements of the gantt.

The component expects customize in the following structure:

```json
{
    "todayButton": {
      "background": "#fff",
      "color": "#000",
      "border": "1px solid #000",
      "border-radius": "5px"
      /** other custom css **/
    },
    "daysContainer": {
      /** your custom css **/
    },
    "taskContainer": {
      /** your custom css **/
    },
    "sidebarProjects": {
      /** your custom css **/
    },
    "modal": {
      /** your custom css **/
    }
}
```
